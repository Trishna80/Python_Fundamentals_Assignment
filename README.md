# Python Fundamentals Assignment

This project contains a set of assignments designed to reinforce basic Python programming concepts, including data types, control structures, functions, and modular programming. The assignment consists of four tasks, each with its own Python file or module, organized in a project folder.

## Task 1: Data Types and Variables

**File:** `data_types.py`

In this task, we explore Python's primitive data types. We create variables of type integer, float, string, and boolean, perform various operations on these variables, and store them in a dictionary. This exercise helps familiarize with variable creation, basic operations, and data structure usage in Python.

## Task 2: Control Structures - Number Classification

**File:** `control_structures.py`

The `classify_number` function in this task asks the user for a number and classifies it as positive, negative, or zero using `if` statements. The function also uses a `while` loop to allow the user to enter multiple numbers until they choose to exit by typing "exit."

## Task 3: Functions - Simple Calculator

**File:** `calculator.py`

This task defines a simple calculator with four functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can choose an operation, enter two numbers, and see the result. The calculator also includes err
